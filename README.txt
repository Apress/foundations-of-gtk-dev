Welcome to the source code that accompanies "Foundations of GTK+ Development". While
this code is open source and available for your use, if you use this for reference,
I would ask that you also buy the book. Either way, I hope these examples can be
good help to you!

Below are instructions for compiling the source code found in this archive. First,
you can compile all of the files in the current directory along with any sub-
directories by typing "make" within that directory. You must have Make installed
for this to work! You can also remove all of the build files by running
"make clean" in any of the directories.

To build a single source file, navigate to the directory where it is held. Then,
run "make sourcefile" to make sourcefile.c.

I hope you enjoy the source code and the book! Gook luck in all of your GTK+
development!
